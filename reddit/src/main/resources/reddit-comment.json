(Assuming it's a male partner.) Either have him see the doctor and explain the issue, or just get some OTC antifungal cream and have him slather it all over his penis 1-2 times a day until the cream is gone, and don't have sex in the mean time. Men can be symptomless carriers of yeast infections and reinfect their partners.\n\nIf you're talking UTIs, make sure your partner has washed their hands thoroughly (especially under the nails!) before messing around, and make sure you go pee after sex. Bacteria getting stuck all up in yo' urethra is a really bad scene.","link_id":"t3_4lv2jw","gilded":0,"subreddit":"TrollXChromosomes","score":2,"retrieved_on":1468728303,"subreddit_id":"t5_2sekm","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":"username","distinguished":null,"controversiality":0,"stickied":false,"id":"d3r7tcp"}
