The Nintendo DS came out in 2004 and was massively successful so it\u0027s not like people weren\u0027t familiar with touch screens in consumer electronics by this point. The phone being a capacitive multitouch screen instead of the resistive screen of the DS is an important difference but as far as scrolling goes they both perform as well as each other. Apple are masters of taking existing tech and making it seem like a bigger deal than it is and the iPhone\u0027s touch screen is no different. It was a good touch screen and they popularised the use of touch screens on mobile devices, but being able to scroll with your finger on consumer electronics was not a new concept.

As such, claiming that these are requirements for joining without consulting MasterOV, who is undeniably the sole authority on this subject, is being dishonest.\n\n\nFor the first example, let us turn to the 7th line entitled \"Warning\", where the OP states that only \"noobs are allowed\". The dictionary definition of noob is \"a person who is inexperienced in a particular sphere or activity, especially computing or the use of the Internet\"; however, according to MasterOv\u0027s channel, he has been playing consistently since May 12th, 2016, which means that he has had over 3 months of experience in diepio, more than most people on this subreddit. If only noobs were allowed, then how would MasterOv himself be allowed in the clan?\n\n\nFurthermore, I have seen posts of this nature 1000 times more innocuous removed by the moderators, who cite rule 5 even when it isn\u0027t applicable. This post, which also directly insults an individual (get that, an individual and not just a clan) is allowed to remain, while posts that merely (and politely) criticize the moderators\u0027 clans are removed instantly.\n\n\nHopefully you will consider these facts and subsequently reconsider your statement. There is a fine line between \"hating\" and \"joking\", one that I believe the OP has certainly crossed.\n\n\n--Also, please note while I do not find the content of this post particularly objectionable, it is no less objectionable than that of other posts that have been removed by the moderators, and therefore should be removed as well, in the interest of fairness. The main goal of the points above was to outline this in detail.--\n","id":"d75uiy7","link_id":"t3_50oxrq"}  1
